Features
--------

- Two interfaces
  - Play by yourself from the terminal. (boring)
  - Play on the web, with ~~griefing~~ coop!
- Cross platform
- Kaboom mode:
  - Cruel but fair, where guessing is punished, 
  but when only guesses are left you are guaranteed not to be wrong.
  - Based on the blog post [here](https://pwmarcz.pl/blog/kaboom/).
- Keyboard or mouse (or hybrid) control
- Standard and Knight's move modes
- Double-width characters (if your terminal supports it)
- QoL features:
  - Highlight adjacent tiles
  - Clear all adjacent
  - Mark all adjacent
  - Shows spaces that were provably empty after a loss (marked with yellow)

CLI
---

- **--size X Y** Specify field size

- **--niceness cruel|normal|fair|nice**
  - **nice** Any click that could result in an empty tile is an empty tile.
  - **fair** If guessing is the only move available, you will not guess wrong.
  - **normal** Traditional minesweeper.
  - **cruel** Any click that could result in a mine is a mine. (Except when guessing is the only move available.)
- **--style single|double** double mode uses full width unicode characters to
  double the cell size. Use single if this causes problems with your terminal.
